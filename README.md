connectfour
===========

A very simple connect four game to demonstrate basic web dev to a novice. 

## HTML

Html is used for the basic building blocks of the game mainly for a table for the layout. Also for importing CSS and JS.

## CSS

CSS is used for adding visiual 'style' to the html for displaying.

## JS

We use JS for the 'moving parts', the event to actually make a move.

## PHP

Only added this to use some server side code. It's used here to reduce code duplication by building the tables in loops.
